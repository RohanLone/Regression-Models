# Regression-Models
A brief introduction to regression. The data set is related to CO_2 emissions from different cars. It includes engine size, number of cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO_2 emission from various automobile models.  The model is used to predict the expected CO_2 emission for a new, or unknown car. Basically, there are two types of regression models. Simple regression, and multiple regression. Simple regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable. When more than one independent variable is present, the processes is called multiple linear regression.
